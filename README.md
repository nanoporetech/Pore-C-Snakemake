# 1. Introduction 

### Overview:

This pipeline manages a pore-c workflow starting from raw fastq files and converting
them to standard file formats for use by downstream tools. The steps involved are:

* Pre-processing a reference genome or draft assembly to generate auxiliary files used in downstream analyses
* Creating virtual digests of the genome
* Filtering the raw reads to remove any that might break downstream tools
* Align against a reference genome
* Processing results to filter spurious alignments, detect ligation junctions and assign fragments. The results are stored in a [parquet](http://parquet.apache.org/) table for downstream processing.
* Converting the results to the following formats:
  - [pairs format](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/pairix/blob/master/pairs_format_specification.md)
  - [cooler format](https://mirnylab.github.io/cooler/) 
  - [hic medium format](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Pre#medium-format-most-common)
  - [salsa2 bed format](https://github.com/marbl/SALSA)


# 2. Getting started

In most cases, it is best to pre-install conda before starting. All other dependencies will be installed automatically when running the pipeline for the first time. 

### Requirements:

This pipleine requires a computer running Linux (Ubuntu 16). >64Gb of memory would be recommended. The pipeline has been tested on minimal server installs of these operating systems.

Most software dependecies are managed using *conda*. To install conda, please install [miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) and refer to installation [instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
You will need to accept the license agreement during installation and we recommend that you allow the Conda installer to prepend its path to your .bashrc file when asked.

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Check if the conda has successfully installed

```
conda -h
```

If conda has installed correctly, you should see the follow output.
If you do not see the below output, you may need to close and reopen your terminal.

```
$ conda
usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...

conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.

Options:

positional arguments:
  command
    clean        Remove unused packages and caches.
    config       Modify configuration values in .condarc. This is modeled
                 after the git config command. Writes to the user .condarc
                 file (/Users/prughani/.condarc) by default.
    create       Create a new conda environment from a list of specified
                 packages.
..............
```

#### Installation:

Clone this git repository to the location where you want to run your analysis and create the conda environment that will be used to run the pipeline

```
git clone https://github.com/nanoporetech/Pore-C-Snakemake.git
cd pore-c-snakemake
## Creates environment and the dependencies will install automatically 
conda env create
conda activate pore_c_snakemake
```
**Note** before you run any of the snakemake commands below  you need to make sure that you've run `conda activate pore_c_snakemake`.

--- 


# 3. Usage

#### Configure workflow:

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the file `config.yaml`. At the very least you need to provide a path to a reference genome.

#### Add basecall location:

Add the locations of your fastq files to `basecall.tsv`. The run IDs must *not* contain any spaces or special characters. 

#### Execute workflow:

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake --use-conda -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake --use-conda --cores $N

using `$N` cores or run it in a cluster environment via

    snakemake --use-conda --cluster qsub --jobs 100

or

    snakemake --use-conda --drmaa --jobs 100

in combination with any of the modes above.
See the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html) for further details.

The snakemake pipeline come with two optional targets: i) `salsa_bed` to create a bed file compatible with salsa2 and ii) `juicebox` which will create files compatible with the juicebox suite of tools. 


```
snakemake --use-conda salsa2_bed
snakemake --use-conda juicebox
```

### Testing:

Test cases are in the subfolder `.test`. To run the tests use

    snakemake --use-conda  -d .test all salsa_bed  juicebox


These require [git lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) to be installed.

# 4. Output files
Once the pipeline has run successfully you should expect the following files in the output directoy:
